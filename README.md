# HPC_Exascalar

This repository contains data on the Top500 Supercomputers from November 2007 to present. The data are extracted from the [Top500](top500.org) and [Green500](green500.org) websites. The list are published biannually in November and June (with minor and insignificant exceptions). The data are aggregated and presented in combined form as single files `results/BigExascalar.csv` and `results/BigExascalar.rda`, with each system (500 per list) assigned a corresponding list.date and associated variables from the two lists.  

### Data Methods:
The lightly cleaned raw data from each website are saved as .csv files in respective `/Top500` and `/Green500` directories. Some cleaning was necessary, especially on the Green500 lists, to ensure data completeness (for example one instance didn't contain the corresponding Top500 ranking, which is the key variable used to concatenate the lists) and consitency (an early version of the Green500, for instance, gave ~equivalent Green systems the same ranking, so the rankings proceeded as 1,2,2,4,... , a practice later dropped).

All the data are combined, using `Exascalar_Cleaner2.R`, current to November 2016, into a single large data file (containing ~9500 rows and 39 columns in November 2016) with cleaned variable names. As the earliest list (2007) had about 25 observations per computer and the current lists tracks almost 40 variables, many data are incomplete over the entire time-span. 

### Variables in `BigExascalar.csv`:

 - __mflopsperwatt:__ efficiency in megaflops per watt.              
 - __architecture:__ description of system architecture.  
 - __processor:__ long processor descriptions (e.g. "Intel Xeon E5-2692v2 12C 2.2GHz").

 - __Exascalar:__ computed exascalar Exascalar = (log10(rmax\*10^{3}/ExaPerf) + log10(mflopsperwatt/(ExaEff)))/sqrt(2))


### note:  
The raw versions of the Top500 data (as .xls files) are stored in the /Top500data/Top500raw directory. Since the Green500 were (until November 2016) avaiable online at .csv files, these are stored as lightly cleaned files in the /Green500 directory. As of November 2016, the Green500 is making only .xlsx files. These are saved in /Green500/Green500raw directory henceforth. Historical Green500 data before November 2014 appear to be no longer available on the website.
